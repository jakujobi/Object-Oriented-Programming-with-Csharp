Discrete math.md

Discrete math is usually set

- Mostly working on Combinations and Permutation
- The arrangements only jumps from one value to another without taking the values in between
- They go over Logic too
- and Sets


- Counting principles
- Multiplication:
  - An experiment split into multiple stages
  - Trying to find how many arrangements
  - Lets say experiment t has these stages where t is the number of stages
  - t = 3 and (s1, s2, s3)
    - If s1 is 3, s2 <- 4, s3 <- 2
    - the number of arrangements is (`2 * 3 * 4`)
  - Lets say we have 5 people in an executive
- 
- hand on we
- Addition
- Inclusion/Exclusion principle
