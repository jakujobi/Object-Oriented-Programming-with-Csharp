1. Discuss the evolution of database management systems (DBMS) and explain the significance of systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL in the modern data landscape.
2. Define a database and elaborate on its role as a shared collection of logically related data within an organization.
3. Compare and contrast relational and non-relational databases, providing examples of scenarios where each would be more appropriate.
4. Describe the general architecture of a database, focusing on the differences between the logical and physical levels.
5. Explain the concept of a data model and its importance in database design, specifically focusing on how it aids in describing data, relationships, semantics, and constraints.
6. Detail the relational model and its use of tables to represent data and relationships. Include an explanation of how this model supports data integrity and efficiency.
7. Differentiate between Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) in the context of database languages, providing examples of operations each can perform.
8. Discuss the significance of primary keys and foreign keys in database design, including how they support data integrity and relationships between tables.
9. Elaborate on the various conditions that can be used in a WHERE clause and how they contribute to the versatility of SQL queries.
10. Explain the order of operations in a SQL query and how understanding this order can lead to more efficient and accurate data retrieval.
11. Describe aggregate functions in SQL and their role in data analysis, providing examples of how and when to use AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX, and COUNT.
12. Explore the concept of subqueries in SQL, including their syntax and practical use cases in complex query construction.
13. Discuss the JOIN operation in SQL, including different types such as INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN, and their implications for data retrieval.
14. Analyze the use of set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT) in SQL and how they can be leveraged to manipulate and combine result sets from multiple queries.
15. Discuss the procedures and implications of modifying a database, including deletion, insertion, and updates, and how these operations affect data integrity and system performance.
16. Describe the process of creating a new table in a database, including considerations for defining columns, data types, and constraints.
17. Explain the significance of integrity constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Check) in maintaining data consistency and integrity within a database.
18. Discuss the implications and processes involved in altering an existing table structure, including adding or dropping columns and changing data types.
19. Explore the advanced use of SQL for data manipulation and retrieval, including techniques such as indexing, stored procedures, and triggers, and their impact on database performance and maintenance.
20. Evaluate the challenges and considerations involved in database design and management, focusing on scalability, security, and performance optimization.
